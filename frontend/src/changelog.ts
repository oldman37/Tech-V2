      'Added a "Permanently Delete" action on Inventory Management, visible to admins only, distinct from Dispose — blocked with a specific reason (e.g. "2 checkout records, 1 repair ticket") if the item has related history, instead of a raw database error.',
      'Redesigned the work order status composer\'s New Status, New Priority, and action-toggle controls from Select dropdowns and plain buttons to a consistent colored chip interface.',
      'Fixed a previously-opened work order card on the mobile Work Orders list staying expanded when you opened a different card — only one card stays open at a time now.',

Skipped on mobile/touch devices so it doesn\'t pop the on-screen keyboard.',
      'Fixed the Checked-Out Carts search box rejecting every keystroke — typing a search term did nothing.',
      'Checked-Out Carts search now also matches the asset tag of a device stored inside a cart and the name of who the cart is checked out to, not just the cart\'s own tag or label.',
      'Fixed the Inventory Management table overflowing into a horizontal scrollbar at intermediate window widths instead of dropping columns like every other table in the app; asset tag, serial number, and PO# now wrap instead of silently failing to truncate.',
      'Replace small next page buttons with a larger, full-width "Next Page" button on mobile for all paginated lists, so it\'s easier to tap.',

      'Permanently deleting an inventory item no longer blocks on related checkout, repair, damage, audit, cart, or import history — choose to keep that history (unlinked, with a note) or remove it entirely when confirming. Replaced the browser confirmation popup with a proper dialog.',
