# Preflight validation gate for Tech-V2.

# Development runs fully in Docker (docker-compose.dev.yml); there are no host
# node_modules. The image builds are therefore the compile/validation gate:

#   - frontend image: frontend tsc -> vite build
#   - test run:       prisma migrate deploy -> npx vitest run (inside backend-test container)
#
# Requires: Docker Desktop running, .env present at repo root (compose interpolation).
# Exit code 0 = all checks passed.
